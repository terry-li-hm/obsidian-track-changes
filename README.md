# Track Changes

Review [CriticMarkup](http://criticmarkup.com/) suggestions in an Obsidian side panel. Accept, reject, or reply — straight back into the markdown, no sidecar state. This branch also preserves Roughdraft-style attribute metadata immediately after each mark, such as `{id="c1" by="Codex" at="2026-05-26T15:51:00Z"}`.

Intended for AI-assisted review: the agent leaves `{++…++}`, `{--…--}`, `{~~old~>new~~}`, `{>>comment<<}`, `{==highlight==}` in your note; you triage them here. A starting-point reviewer prompt lives at [`docs/SKILL.md`](https://github.com/philphilphil/obsidian-track-changes/blob/main/docs/SKILL.md). For *authoring* CriticMarkup yourself, see [Fevol/obsidian-criticmarkup](https://github.com/Fevol/obsidian-criticmarkup).

## Features

- All five CriticMarkup forms with inline styling and a side-panel card per mark
- Threaded comments (adjacent `{>>…<<}` blocks), multi-author colors
- Accept / reject per mark, reply inline, delete per message or thread
- **Finalize for publish** — resolves all remaining markup in one pass
- Reading mode: accepted preview or raw side-by-side
- Code blocks left alone
- Roughdraft attributes stay attached to their mark for edits, are hidden in reading mode, and are written on new panel replies

## Interaction

- **Click a mark** in Live Preview to edit in place — the raw markup is exposed, the color stays.
- **⌘/Ctrl-click a mark** (or set *Click highlighted text to open in panel*) opens the side panel instead.
- **Click a panel card** to jump the editor to its chip.
- **Source Mode** shows raw markup verbatim.

## Commands

- *Open review panel*
- *Finalize for publish* — accept additions, drop deletions and comments, etc.

## Install

**Community Plugins** → search "Track Changes" ([community.obsidian.md](https://community.obsidian.md/plugins/track-changes)).

Manual: drop `main.js`, `manifest.json`, `styles.css` into `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/track-changes/`.

## Build

```sh
npm install && npm run build
```

## Runtime Smoke Test

After building, run the optional Obsidian smoke test:

```sh
npm run test:obsidian
```

It launches Obsidian against a generated disposable vault under `test/.obsidian-smoke/`, enables only this local plugin build, opens a CriticMarkup/Roughdraft fixture, verifies the review panel, writes one reply through the panel, and then shuts the isolated Obsidian process down.
